      <p>Currently, I work at Replit as the VP of Marketing and Design. My background is multi-disciplinary in engineering, design, business, and marketing with nearly 20 years of experience in tech. I synthesize my purpose in a life-time mission of building and investing in tools that revolutionize the internet.</p>
      <p>Before Replit, I helped scale companies as the first Head of Design at both Webflow and One Medical for nearly a decade of my life. I started my career as a UI Designer for iOS applications in the early days of the app store, started my own software studio (Xhatch Interactive), and was Director of Mobile Design at Black Pixel.</p>
