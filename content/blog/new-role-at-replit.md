This past week, I started a new role at Replit as VP of Marketing and Design. I'm so grateful for Amjad and Haya for giving me this opportunity. All-too-often, companies look at the status quo of how other companies do things and copy/paste. At Replit, we talk a lot about what "The Replit Way" of doing things are. This is one of them.

With a new role comes new responsibilities, and I'm up for the challenge. Marketing and Design are often viewed as two completely different departments, and it shouldn't be. When you boil it down to the essence, both departments are thinking about the end-to-end customer experience and should be infused.

In the future, I see more PLG leaders coming from a design background. We'll be hiring across Marketing, including Dev Rel, Community, and Marketing Ops. If you're excited about Replit's mission and vision, I'd love to chat.
