I was inspired by my friend and former teammate [Kyle Lambert's year in review](https://www.imkylelambert.com/articles/2023-year-in-review) and thought I'd do one myself.

## Highs
- Kinference in Brooklyn was a freaking blast! It was the first time I've seen people in a conference since before COVID
- Met [Ben the cat](https://twitter.com/davidhoang/status/1625540038409994240), who I've known for several years over Zoom
- Visiting New York several times this year for work and friends
- Jessica and I celebrated five years together
- Went to Hawaii for a week-long vacation
- Moved back to San Francisco (splitting time in the desert!). It's great to be back in the city and building
- Hosted three Vietnamese Designers dinners with [Christina Nguyen White](https://twitter.com/ChristinaNWhite)

## Lows
- Webflow ████████████████████
- Health goals got off track this year. In the midst of offsites and conferences, I ate _too_ well
- Even though Wilson passed away last year in February of 2022, it's still a tough adjustment not having him around

## Misses
- Wish I could have traveled up to Washington more to visit my family, especially my newphew
- I was one kill away from the Juggernaut kill streak on Shipment (Shipment!) in Call of Duty. I got too worried about getting kill instead of continuing to play aggressive. I didn't get it

## Professional
- 6 designers I used to work with (Webflow and One Medical) were promoted to Staff Designer—congrats to them all!
- 4 angel investments and 1 LP investment
- [Idea to software, fast](https://twitter.com/davidhoang/status/1704733619095544311) campaign at replit
- Launched the [Replit Core membership](https://blog.replit.com/replit-core)

## The DH awards
The best of 2023, determined by me and based only on my opinions.

**Best movie:** Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse

**Best TV show:** Winning Time: Season 2

**Article of the year:** [Why Chatbots are not the future](https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/boo-chatbots) by [Amelia Wattenberger](https://twitter.com/Wattenberger)

**Meme of the year:** That motherfucker is not real!

 **Top confession:** I have not seen Barbie or Oppenheimer

**Restaurant of the year:** [Niku Steakhouse](https://www.nikusteakhouse.com/) in San Francisco


## 2024 hopes
A few things I'd like to experience more of in the new year.

- Travel to a city I've never been in the United States: Atlanta, Miami, or Philly
- Have more friends visit and stay with us in Palm Springs
- Morning walking conversations in San Francisco
