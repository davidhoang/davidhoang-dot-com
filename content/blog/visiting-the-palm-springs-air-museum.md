I am a person that hopes there are no wars and conflicts, but have such a fascination with military technology and air superiority! It started as a kid when one of my uncles took me to the Museum of Flight in Seattle and was an avid fan of comic books and aviation. I dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot as a kid, and being color blind definitely killed that dream swiftly.

Fast forward to today and I still find a lot of inspiration through R&D and technology. I take a lot of inspiration from Lockheed Martin's Skunkworks program and Kelly Johnson, the long time head of the secret division that created aircraft such as the U2 Spy Plane, SR-71 Blackbird (AKA the jet the X-Men fly in), and the F-117 Nighthawk. I went to the Palm Springs Air Museum this week, which had one of the 59 ever constructed on display.

If you're not familiar with the Nighthawk it probably looks like a Cyber Truck based on it's diamond shape. There's a great documentary about the development of the first fully stealth plane on [The History Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz-85MySPQk&t=2s) As a kid who played countless hours of the [F-117 Stealth Fighter 2.0 game on the PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-117A_Nighthawk_Stealth_Fighter_2.0), it was so cool to see one of these in person.

If you ever find yourself in Palm Springs and like museums or aviation, I recommend visiting the [Palm Springs Air Museum](https://palmspringsairmuseum.org/).
