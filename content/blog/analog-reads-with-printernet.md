I get migraine headaches from blue light and try to keep screen time at a minimum. As a result of this, my favorite mode of reading is physical paper (e-ink is great though). Printernet is an awesome experimental project that curates reads you may enjoy. It's like an RSS feed on physical paper. They are so thoughtful about the curation and include a page on why the essay was selected for you.

I'm certainly going to print more issues and encourage you to give it a try!
