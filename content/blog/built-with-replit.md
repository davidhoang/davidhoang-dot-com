I switched [davidhoang.com](https://davidhoang.com) to be built, deployed, and maintained all on Replit. The switch from Webflow to Replit took me about a weekend to get it all done.

For personal sites, I wanted to keep it simple since the only person who will ever maintain it is me. I opted to choose a static site generator. The last time I built a static site without a CMS like Webflow of Wordpress was Jekyll in the early 2010s!

Ruby has a close place to my heart as it's one of the first programming languages I learned, but decided it was time to try something different. I chose [Hugo](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjxw9GPio-BAxVWh-4BHe0fAtUQFnoECBkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Freplit.com%2F%40replit%2FHugo&usg=AOvVaw2Q9PFNddGLFYb_2jNICO7J&opi=89978449) as my static site generator using the Etch theme. I wrote my own CSS to make it look like my old Webflow site.

My workflow is simple:
1. Write blog content in markdown using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Edit, build, and ship with [Replit](http://replit.com)

Ghostwriter was great to help me refactor my code and ask questions about Hugo's framework. I hate to read documentation and having Ghostwriter help me through it saved so much time.

Do I think site builders are bad? Of course not. I used to work at Webflow. However, as AI becomes more normalized in our work, [it won't matter if it's no-code or code](https://twitter.com/davidhoang/status/1695972312657596877).

Whether it's an application or static website, I'd love if you gave [Replit](http://replit.com) a try; would love feedback on how we can improve the experience.
