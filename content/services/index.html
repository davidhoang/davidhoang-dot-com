    <h2>What is fractional leadership?</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you're a small startup or a large company, fractional leadership is a way to help you grow and scale. Fractional leadership is a flexible model that ensures you're getting value as needed and not over-scaling the company when it's not necessary. 
    </p>

He provides fresh perspectives, operational best practices, mentorship and skill development, cross-functional collaboration, and valuable guidance to enhance the overall design capabilities and outcomes of the organization.
